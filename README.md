# THE ROOM

The Room is a funny text game created in React (without Redux). The goal is to win, basically. However, there are multiple ways in which you can do that. 
Bear in mind, though, that this game has multiple endings, both positive and negative. Can you find them all? Try it out!

## Share and improve!

This game was my personal project to test out building slightly more complex React applications without using any reducers (such as Redux).
It has been built with a community expansion later on in mind. This means that everyone is invited
to improve the game and expand it further, with more and more stories to tell, more ways to win and, obviously, more ways to lose.

If you are a beginner with React, it is a cool opportunity for you to test and polish your skills!
Furthermore, you might even want to improve the entire infrastructure of the code, which in its current state is not that great, really.
In fact, most of it has been designed before I learned more advanced patterns, so it is very likely that there is a much better way to organize the code.
If you feel like trying out your optimization skills, then this is an excellent opportunity to try and do so.

Feel free to fork this project and add more and more improvements to it!

Cheers!
